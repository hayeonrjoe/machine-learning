Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICCs) for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC): Despite substantial improvements in survival outcomes relative to sorafenib, many patients with HCC do not derive durable benefit from ICI regimens currently available standard of care first line therapies. Advances such single cell RNA sequencing and other techniques have created potential to identify novel predictive biomarkers enabling the accurate selection for patient who are most likely derived benefits form ICIs . Current biomarker use in clinical practice includes gene signatures circulating tumor cells high dimensional flow cytometry as well approaches involving microbiome radiomics or Clinical markers that incorporate molecular profiling of tumors. Novel concepts include spatial transcriptomics and integrated big data analysis approach which hold promise to improve the accuracy identifying patient who are most likely benefit from therapies targeting ICIs
