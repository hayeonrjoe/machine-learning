Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and tremelimumab plus durvalumab are standard-of-care first-line therapies. Despite survival improvements, many patients do not benefit long-term from these regimens. Advances in genome sequencing and immune cell identification offer potential for predictive biomarkers. The review summarizes immunology data and outcomes in ICI-treated HCC patients. Current biomarker use and recent developments, including gene signatures and single-cell RNA sequencing, are outlined. Novel concepts for biomarker development, such as spatial transcriptomics and 'big data' analysis, are discussed. These approaches aim to better identify patients likely to benefit from ICIs and advance treatment strategies.
