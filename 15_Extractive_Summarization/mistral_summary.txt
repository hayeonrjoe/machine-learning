Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and tremelimumab plus durvalumab as approved first-line therapies. Most patients do not derive durable benefit from these regimens despite survival improvements compared to sorafenib. Advances in genome sequencing, immune cell identification strategies, radiomics, microbiota analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing offer potential for identifying novel predictive biomarkers. This review summarizes the immunology of HCC and patient outcomes with ICIs, current biomarker use, and developments in the past 5 years. Gene signatures, circulating tumor cells, high-dimensional flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, microbiome analysis, radiomics, and clinical markers are discussed as current biomarker approaches. Novel concepts for further biomarker development include biomarker-driven trials, spatial transcriptomics, and integrated 'big data' analysis approaches to better identify patients likely to benefit from ICIs and promote new treatment approaches.
